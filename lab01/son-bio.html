    <title>Shiho Son - Bio</title>
</head>
<body>
My name is Shiho Son. I am currently majoring in selected studies in the School of Education but am interested in transferring to the ischool to study information management and technology. I am interested in that field because the position/career of project management interests me. The idea of working as a team yet being a leader to guide your coworkers by foreseeing the task at hand is something I wish to pursue. A couple of accomplishments and skills of mine are: Receiving a gold medal (completing 250+ hours) for volunteer work that includes teaching technology to the elderly, good organization skills, and a creative mindset. Outside of work, some of my hobbies are: Working out, listening/creating music, and eating good food. I usually like to watch a lot of shows on Netflix, mainly Korean shows, and my favorite movie is the Pursuit of Happyness. Back home, Queens NY, I live with my mom, dad and my younger sister. My family is fluent in both English and Korean, so a funny “habit” of ours would be speaking in Konglish (Korean + English) often when we speak.
