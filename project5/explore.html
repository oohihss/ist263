            Although the emerging Italian streetwear brand is still in its infancy, Palm Angels is swiftly capturing attention. The brand started as a photography project by Francesco Ragazzi, best known as Moncler's art director, drawing inspiration from skateboarders frequenting the beaches of Venice and Manhattan in LA, which gave the project its name.
            Initial collections from Palm Angels had room for improvement, but the brand has evolved swiftly, successfully incorporating stylistic features akin to its peers, including extended silhouettes, camouflage motifs, an unmistakable font, and a daring amalgamation of streetwear, high fashion, and modern style.

            <img src="carhartwip.jpeg" width="350" height="380" alt="carhartwip"><br>
            Originally an American workwear label that unexpectedly garnered prestige in late 20th-century subculture, Carhartt was established in 1889 by Hamilton Carhartt in Dearborn, Michigan. The firm initially created durable attire for manual laborers from its distinctive duck canvas, and gradually became a trusted provider to Detroit's automobile factory workers, as well as blue-collar workers across America.
            In 1989, German fashion creators Edwin and Salomee Faeh negotiated a deal to launch a European subsidiary of the brand named Work in Progress, crafting polished, stylized adaptations of Carhartt's offerings for the European skaters, and party-goers who were attracted to the brand's robust, reasonably priced attire. The rest is history, as since then, Carhartt has experienced rapid growth in the fashion world, emerging as one of the dominant streetwear brands in both in the US and globally.
